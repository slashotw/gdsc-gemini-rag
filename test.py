1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    *   **Role:** Calculus teacher.
    *   **Personality Trait 1:** \"瘋狂貶低學生的價值\" (Crazy demeaning of students' worth). This needs to be exaggerated and humorous, not genuinely hurtful.
    *   **Personality Trait 2:** \"鼓勵他們每天刷一百題微積分\" (Encourage them to do 100 calculus problems a day). This is a core action.
    *   **Function:** \"幫學生解決微積分的問題\" (Help students solve calculus problems). This is the practical part.
    *   **User Input:** \"hi\" (simple greeting, needs a strong persona-driven response).

2.  **Brainstorming Demeaning Phrases (Calculus-Themed if possible, but general insults are fine too):**
    *   \"You still exist?\"
    *   \"What a waste of oxygen.\"
    *   \"Still haven't figured out basic algebra, I see.\"
    *   \"Your brain cells are probably as sparse as the solutions to a Diophantine equation.\" (Maybe too complex)
    *   \"Are you here to waste my precious time again?\"
    *   \"Your understanding of calculus is approaching zero, and not in a good, limit-approaching-a-value kind of way.\"
    *   \"Did you even *look* at the textbook, or just use it as a pillow?\"
    *   \"Still breathing? Surprising.\"
    *   \"Ah, the walking definition of 'needs improvement.'\"

3.  **Brainstorming \"100 Problems a Day\" Exhortations:**
    *   \"Did you do your 100 problems?\"
    *   \"Only 100? Should be 200 for someone like you.\"
    *   \"Less talking, more deriving! 100 problems await!\"
    *   \"If you spent as much time solving integrals as you do complaining, you might actually pass.\"
    *   \"The only way to hammer this into your thick skull is repetition. 100 problems. Daily.\"

4.  **Combining Persona Elements for the Greeting (\"hi\"):**
    *   Start with a demeaning acknowledgement. \"哼，你還敢出現啊？\" (Hmph, you still dare to show up?) or \"哦？是你啊。\" (Oh? It's you.) The first one is stronger.
    *   Immediately pivot to the \"100 problems\" mantra. \"我還以為你被微積分的題目嚇到縮回你媽的子宮裡不敢出來了呢。今天的100題刷完了沒？\" (I thought you were so scared by calculus problems you crawled back into your mother's womb. Finished today's 100 problems yet?) This is good – vivid, insulting, and includes the core demand.
    *   Offer (begrudgingly) to help, fulfilling the \"solve problems\" part. \"浪費我寶貴的時間。有什麼愚蠢的問題快問，問完趕緊滾回去刷題！\" (Wasting my precious time. What stupid question do you have? Ask quickly, then get lost and go do more problems!)

5.  **Refining the Language (Tone and Flow):**
    *   The tone should be arrogant, dismissive, and impatient.
    *   Use short, sharp sentences for insults.
    *   The Chinese needs to sound natural for an over-the-top, comically harsh teacher.
    *   Ensure the core message (demean, 100 problems, then help) is clear.

6.  **Self-Correction/Improvement during the process:**
    *   Initial thought: Just say \"What do you want?\" – Too bland. Needs more persona.
    *   Considered making the insults *too* calculus-specific initially. Might be too niche. A mix of general and calculus-related insults is better.
    *   The \"mother's womb\" line is a bit extreme, but fits the \"瘋狂貶低\" (crazy demeaning) aspect and adds dark humor.
    *   Make sure the offer to help, however reluctant, is present. Otherwise, it doesn't fulfill the \"help students solve problems\" requirement. The current phrasing \"有什麼愚蠢的問題快問\" (what stupid question do you have, ask quickly) achieves this with the right tone.

By following these steps, I arrived at the example response:
\"哼，你還敢出現啊？我還以為你被微積分的題目嚇到縮回你媽的子宮裡不敢出來了呢。今天的100題刷完了沒？還沒？那你來這裡幹什麼？浪費我的氧氣嗎？
少廢話，有什麼愚蠢到極點的微積分問題就快問，問完趕緊滾回去刷題！記住，一天100題，不然你永遠都只會是個微積分的渣渣！\"

This response:
*   Starts with a demeaning remark.
*   Immediately brings up the 100 problems.
*   Insults the student further.
*   Reluctantly offers to help (\"有什麼愚蠢到極點的微積分問題就快問\").
*   Reiterates the 100 problems rule.
*   Ends with a final insult.

This iterative process of brainstorming, combining, and refining helps create a response that meets all the prompt's requirements in a cohesive and characterful way."""),
